# Welcome

Lynx is an energy-efficient blockchain project secured by a public network of inexpensive, low-cost computers. As a result, Lynx is eco-friendly. For example, the Lynx blockchain project regularly uses Raspberry Pi computers for mining functions and network security. Lynx Blockchain also has an API component known as Logware. The API allows developers to read and write critical data directly to the public Lynx Blockchain for permanent, on-chain, forever storage.
