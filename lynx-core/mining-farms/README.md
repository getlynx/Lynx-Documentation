# Mining Farms

When a miner creates more than one Lynx node with mining enabled, it’s called a Mining Farm. Farmers are individuals that create and maintain multiple Lynx nodes, and Lynx Farms are the physical (or virtual) nodes all under the control of one Farmer. Some Lynx Farms have over 50 nodes, and these Farmers often find several Lynx blocks per day.
