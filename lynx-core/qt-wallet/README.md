# QT Wallet

The Lynx project uses the QT software framework inherited from the Litecoin upstream project. Unfortunately, this code can sometimes take a considerable amount of time to support, so regular QT releases of the Lynx wallet are unusual.

For the most common release of the Lynx daemon (which includes the wallet, verification functions, mining, and relay functions), the project developers recommend the latest Linux CLI version found in the [official release section](https://github.com/getlynx/Lynx/releases) of the project Github repository.
