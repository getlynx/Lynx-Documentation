# Linux Desktop

Various wallet types are available for Linux ARM and AMD processors. These wallets are often the most up-to-date and recommended for the Raspberry Pi and desktop Linux computers. The most efficient version is [the 'min' version](https://github.com/getlynx/Lynx/releases/tag/v0.16.3.12) found at the project Github. The 'minimal' version is CLI (command-line interface), so you must be comfortable with the terminal experience on your computer.&#x20;

The 'minimal' versions run pretty well on VPS vendors like Linode, Digital Ocean, Scaleway, and AWS (to name a few).
