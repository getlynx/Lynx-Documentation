The Lynx Core blockchain is unique in that its code includes a design to discourage the use of high-volume power-hungry mining rigs because the code purposefully lacks incentives to mine Lynx for profit. As a result, the entire Lynx network operates on a global collaboration of low-power devices that anyone can run, resulting in a collective global mining cost of only dollars a day.
