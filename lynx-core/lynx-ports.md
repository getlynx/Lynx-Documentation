# Lynx Ports

The default mainnet port for the public Lynx blockchain is 22566.&#x20;

For RPC access on the mainnet, please use port 9332.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not intend to use the RPC port on your Lynx node, we recommend restricting the port with your firewall. Blocking the RPC port is not required, but we prefer to see the extra security. In addition, an extremely long (32 character) RPC username and password are recommended.
{% endhint %}

The default testnet port is 44566. The RPC port for testnet is 19335.
