# LynxCI

LynxCI facilitates the quick creation and maintenance of Lynx nodes. The one-line bash script installer allows for fast deployment of the Lynx daemon on server, VPS, and ordinary home computers that use the Linux operating system. The latest hardware is not required, but more current Linux operating systems are. Debian is the primary target OS for the LynxCI installer as it has the broadest installation base, stability, and support.

The LynxCI project is entirely open source. Therefore, you can review the code before installation and even submit change requests if you find a bug or have a request.

The following command should be executed from the root user account on a freshly installed Debian 11 operating system with no prior packages installed for the quickest setup.

```
wget -qO - https://getlynx.io/install.sh | bash
```
