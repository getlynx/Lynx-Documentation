# Get Started

After 20 minutes, you can log into your Raspberry Pi 4 with the default username and password. The default username and password for LynxCI are ‘lynx’ and ‘lynx,’ respectively. LynxCI will immediately prompt you to change the password.

Please write down your new password, and don’t lose it. If you get locked out of your Pi, you have to start over. If you lose your password to the lynx account, you have no recourse. This is a feature, not a bug. We prefer security over convenience. LynxCI locks the root account on the Pi. This protocol is also used for a VPS installation of the one-line installer of LynxCI.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Many VPS vendors have a 'console' access method to gain root access to the VPS, and with those tools, you CAN gain access to root on your VPS. It’s not ideal, but it helps if you find yourself stuck.
