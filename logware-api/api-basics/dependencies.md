# Dependencies

The Logware API is written and designed by the same development team maintaining the Lynx Core codebase. The two entities are purposefully designed to work well together. Therefore, no changes are made to the Lynx Core codebase that might upset the smooth functioning of the Logware API.

{% hint style="info" %}
When an API key gets generated for a developer, the use of the key gets explicitly set for a specific API method. Please specify which method you would like your API key to expose.
{% endhint %}
