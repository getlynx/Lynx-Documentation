# How did Clevver originate?



The Lynx blockchain was designed to be an eco-friendly, public blockchain specifically used for data storage. The Logware API is an easy-to-use gateway for customers to automatically and permanently store data.

During the NFT craze starting in 2021, it became apparent that a permanent data storage solution was needed for the image asset portion of an NFT. While the provenance data of the NFT is stored on a smart contract platform and can't be lost or manipulated, the art asset needs the same level of reliable integrity.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
NFT collectors are looking for unique features that will drive value and, sometimes, utility. Collectors are interested in acquiring NFTs that have the characteristic of being forever accessible as a built-in trait. This provides peace of mind that the image of the NFT will never be lost or changed, and with time, high-value NFTs can be collateralized due to the permanent storage feature of the digital file.
{% endhint %}

Since the Lynx development team created Logware and corporate customers were already using the API successfully, a small 'reference application' was deployed to allow creatives to store digital files easily with a drag and drop user interface.&#x20;

The [Clevver website](https://clevver.org/) allows individuals to store a single file for free once a day. If an artist or project needs to keep large numbers of images, they can use the Clevver desktop application for bulk drag and drop simplicity for permanent image storage. While the Clevver website is free, the use of the desktop application requires a license per project.

If your NFT project would benefit from forever storage of the art files, please contact us.&#x20;
